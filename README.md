# Overview
The Blockchain Benchmarking Framework will focus on the development of a user-friendly UI that abstracts the underlying complexities of blockchain technology and allows the user to have a seamless and easy interaction with the framework. The goal of the project is to enable usability for: (a) the demand (i.e., developers, technical teams, managers), (b) the supply (i.e., organizations and companies that provides data and/or services and wish to adopt blockchain technology) and (c) the academic (i.e., researchers, students, educators).
